    "I am giving the next take home assignment. This is related to one of the models \n",
    "you will be building later on during the course - Linear Regression. But before you build a model, \n",
    "you will need to have a method to extract the data and process it in your data frames and convert to numpy. \n",
    "This is the assignment for this week. Process the data set given(\"airfoil_self_noise.dat\", a tab seperated text file).  \n",
    "Specifically write code to use Pandas to read the data set and convert the data into numpy. The data set has 6 attributes - \n",
    "and they are explained below: Columns 1 to 5 are features, and column 6 is the Y_data. Please store the columns 1 to 5 in \n",
    "numpy array (called X_data in future), and store column 6 in numpy array as Y_data. The shape of Y_data should be (num rows, 1),\n",
    "and X_data (numrows, 5). \n",
    "You will using the data set given here to predict the value of the attribute 6 - \"Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels\" \n",
    "as given below. You will write a model processing the X_data and learn the parameters used to predict Y_data. \n",
    "Once you have learned the parameters, you can use those parameters to predict sound pressure for any new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is the goal of Supervised Machine Learning.  In case you find this topic a bit advanced, don't worry. \n",
    "This concept will be explained in the coming weeks of Machine Learning. \n",

    "sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel. The data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind \n",
    "tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments. \n",
    "The data set has 6 attributes as given below. \n",
